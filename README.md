#### Installation
    * Extract the archive. Upload the extracted folder(orangescrum-master) to your working directory.

	You can change the write permission of "app/Config" folder after installation procedure is completed.
    * Create a new MySQL database named "orangescrum"(`utf8_unicode_ci` collation).
    * Get the database.sql file from the root directory and import that to your database.
    * Locate your `app` directory, do the changes on following files:
	  * `app/Config/database.php` - We have already updated the database name as "Orangescrum" which you can change at any point. In order to change it, just create a database using any name and update that name as database in DATABASE_CONFIG section. And also you can set a password for your Mysql login which you will have to update in the same page as password. [Required]
